## Instructions
The project uses `conda` for package, environment, and dependency management via the `environment.yml` file, which tracks the project dependencies, including the python version against which our system is stable. Please make sure you have [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed before proceeding. 

The script we provide will install the necessary dependencies and execute the test scripts.
```
sh run_tests.sh
```
Each test script generates intermediate and final output files in the `test_scripts/` directory.
